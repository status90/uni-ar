This project aims to conduct A Preliminary Investigation of Augmented Reality Applications in University Environments by introducing Augmented Reality in day-to-day university applications .We plan to use Augmented Reality(AR) to develop three basic modules and thus demonstrate the use of AR in building highly interactive media which could help in introducing a greater level of interactivity in the current university activities.
